2)PERFECT BINARY TREE- A full binary tree with all levels completely filled.

3)COMPLETE BINARY TREE- A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level
  and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
  "except possibly the last level" part of above definition specifies exception which need to satisfied always.Last level may or 
  may not be completely filled.
