The Segment Tree of array A of size 7

will look like :

Take an example. Given an array A
of size N

and some queries. There are two types of queries:

    Update: Given idx

and val, update array element A[idx] as A[idx]=A[idx]+val
.
Query: Given l
and r return the value of A[l]+A[l+1]+A[l+2]+…..+A[r−1]+A[r] such that 0≤l≤r<N

Queries and Updates can be in any order.

Naive Algorithm:
This is the most basic approach. For every query, run a loop from l
to r and calculate the sum of all the elements. So each query will take O(N) time.
