Tries are an extremely special and useful data-structure that are based on the prefix of a string. They are used to represent 
the “Retrieval” of data and thus the name Trie.

Prefix :The prefix of a string is nothing but any n letters n≤|S| that can be considered beginning strictly from the starting of 
        a string.

A Trie is a special data structure used to store strings that can be visualized like a graph. It consists of nodes and edges. Each
node consists of at max 26 children and edges connect each parent node to its children. These 26 pointers are nothing but pointers
for each of the 26 letters of the English alphabet
Strings are stored in a top to bottom manner on the basis of their prefix in a trie. All prefixes of length 1 are stored at until 
level 1, all prefixes of length 2 are sorted at until level 2 and so on.
